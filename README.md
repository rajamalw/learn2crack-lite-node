# learn2crack-lite-node
This project is specifically aimed at learn2crack.com.

Desktop website can be rendered as a WebView in a hybrid Android app but it will be heavy and loads many stuff which can be implemented natively in Android app in a more effective way. 

This node project creates a proxy server which fetches original site html from learn2crack.com and strips unneeded content like ad, analytics scripts, sidebar sections and other unnneeded scripts and sends back the minimal html to the client.
